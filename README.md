# RAIINET-documentation
This repository is for the public documentation of my RAIINET C++ game. Full code cannot be published as much of it stems from a major university project, as such answers cannot be published. Furthermore, Dylan and Joshua were collaborators for the initial realization of this game, but code as since been further modified.

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to see or discuss the source code!
